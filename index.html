                        and strutting my feet "Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there anyone I could call?" "No
                        and thank you, please Madam. I ain't lost, just wandering." Round my hometown Memories are fresh

                        that we ain't gonna stand shit Shows that we are united Shows that we ain't gonna take it Shows that
