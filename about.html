            <p>Adele was born in North London, England, on May 5, 1988, eventually attending the performing arts BRIT School.
                Her first two albums, 19 and 21, earned her critical praise and a level of commercial success unsurpassed
                among her peers, with the artist selling millions of albums worldwide and winning multiple Grammys. She also
                received a songwriting Oscar for the James Bond track "Skyfall." After becoming a mom, Adele returned to
                the charts in autumn 2015 with the ballad "Hello," the lead single from what was dubbed her comeback album
                25. In 2017, she won five Grammys for her work on 25 including album, record and song of the year for "Hello."</p>
